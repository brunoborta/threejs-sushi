# Three.js Sushi

I recently did a one course of @romanklco, which was shown how to create a sushi scene in blender. I did all the work there, and thought it would be a good idea to export this to three.js!

## Setup

Download [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/).
I'm using yarn for this project so it should be installed
Run this followed commands:

```bash
# Install yarn if you don't already have
npm i yarn -g

# Install dependencies (only the first time)
yarn

# Run the local server at localhost:5173
yarn dev

# Build for production in the dist/ directory
yarn build
```

## Next Steps

I am not a professional designer or modeler in Blender, so I had a few mistakes with the baking process, specifically with the sushis themselves. The shape inside the rice is pretty chaotic. I tried to cut it the best I could, and I got a very good result from v1 to v2, but it's still not perfect. If you would like to play with it, I'm adding the .blend file with .hdr, so you have exactly the same I have.
